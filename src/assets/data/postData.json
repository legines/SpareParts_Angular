        "contentOne": "Today I am finally motivated enough to install the front lip on my Z. This lip has been sitting in my office for a couple of months now, but since the suspension is done and there is a car's and coffee meet on the 6th, now is the time to get it done. The install was alright. I didnt jack the car up or use my diy wood ramps because of laziness. First the lip came in three pieces, which can be assembled together by a couple of screws. I bought some 3M double sided tape to help hold the lip onto the bumper while I drilled the holes. The tape was applied on the parts of the lip that would touch the bumper.",

        "contentTwo": "Next I took a couple of extra pieces of wood and used them to prop up the lip, using jacks, onto the bumper as a test fit. Once everything was adjust and lined up good I removed the wood and jacks and stuck random items under the lip to hold it in place. The wood and jacks were getting in my way too much so my tire inflator and random tool boxes were used to hold the lip. After that I double checked the fitment of the lip before peeling off the backing of the tape. One side was done at a time, peeling off the tape backing and sticking the lip onto the bumper. After that I attached the lip to the bumper using self tapping screws. Overall it didnt take too long to do and imo looks awesome.",

        "contentOne": "Today I am fixing several issues that need to be addressed before I take the car in for an alignment on the 14th. The first issue is the broken hex bolt on the drivers side upper control arm. I ordered a new one from SPL and it arrived earlier this week. Luckily there was enough of the broken bolt sticking out that I was able to use a pair of vice grips to unscrew it. The new bolt was installed easily with a 3/8th hex socket and torqued to 150 in/lbs.",

        "contentTwo": "The next issue is that the car is way too low. After the initial coilover install the front of the car was sitting super low. If I remember correctly it was about 3.25 inches to 3.5 inches off the ground. I wanted the car to ideally be 4 inches off the ground in the front and about 4 1/8 inches in the rear. So I adjusted the coilovers to raise the car up, which will be a separate post. This took me a couple of days to get right because after each adjustment I had to drive the car around to let the suspension settle, and unfortunately the suspension settled about .25 inches. The way I was calculating the height of the car while I was adjusting the coils was not that accurate so I ended up having to do a lot of trial and error until I learned to do it the right way. I was taking measurements of the height of the side skirts near the front and rear wheels, which was not that accurate. Ill get into more details in a followup post, but anyways after one of my final adjustments the front wheels started to rub on the fender liners. There is a spot in the fender liners that bulges out because behind that spot is the bracket that connects the fender to the front bumper. I didnt take a picture of it, but I used a knife to cut out the bulging part of the fender liner so that the wheel wouldnt rub. After a lot of adjustments to the coils I was able to get the front to sit at 4 inches and the rear at 4 1/8 inchers. Now the car is ready for an alignment.",

As I lowered the car I installed 25mm spacers on the front and rear, but the car felt like it wasnt accelerating as hard as it was before. These spacers weigh 2.4 lbs each, so the added rotational mass was making the car feel slower. The Z1 rotors are 10 lbs lighter on the front and 5 lbs lighter on the rear compared to the stock rotors, which ended up restoring the acceleration feel of the car due to the reduced rotational mass.",

I took a breaker bar and hit it with a hammer to loosen the bolts and then slipped the calipers off. Most people use caliper hangers to hold the calipers up, to not add stress to the brake lines, but I rested them on my jack. The spacers need to come off before the rotors can be removed, and then the rotors slipped right off since the car is still pretty new and there was no rust holding them on. Before putting on the new rotors I cleaned them with brake cleaner to remove any oils from manufacturing. The new rotors went on easily, then the spacers were put back on and those spacer nuts were torqued to 90 ft/lbs. The calipers were then put back on and torqued to 73 ft/lbs.",

This is because the traction arm is in the way. Using a combination of a swivel socket and an extension, I was able to get a socket onto the bolt. However, I decided not to remove the rear rotors because it was impossible to attach a torque wrench to the bolt and I wasnt going to risk driving around with loose bolts. So I let my suspension shop handle the rear rotor install when I took the car in to get the aligment dialed in.",

If the suspension is already taken apart, you might as well replace them. The install in theory is easy if you have ramps or a lift. This is because the endlinks need to be installed with the weight of the car on the wheels, preventing preload on the sway bar. So, ideally you would have the car up on ramps, on wood blocks, or if you have two jacks you can jack up both wheels to whatever height is the stock height to simulate the car being level. I didnt have ramps, a lift, wood, or two jacks so the endlink install was a big fail. Since then I have created some ramps out of wood, which I might post about idk. The endlinks would not go into the sway bar holes at all. At this point I was just trying to install them so I could drive to the aligment shop and get them to adjust them correctly.",

        "contentOne": "I bought Fortune Auto 500 coilovers, SPL front upper control arms, SPL rear camber arms, SPL rear toe arms, a Z1 diff brace, and Z1 2 piece slotted rotors last black friday. These parts have sat in my office until today. Enough is enough I cant stare at them anymore, so let's get to it. It's been a minute since I worked on cars (the 350z days) so I inevitably made some mistakes on the first side I started on. Although I have an impact, it is very old and not that powerful, it struggled to break bolts loose and instead I used a breaker bar for everything. So removing suspension components from the front isnt hard, but there are more things that need to come off compared to the rear. First, I started by loosening the three 12mm nuts at the top of the shock, these are found in the engine bay. The strut tower bar does NOT need to be removed to find these bolts, unlike on the 350z. I then removed the 14mm bolt that holds the front upper control arm's ball joint to the steering knuckle, whch gave me a lot of room to be able to eventually remove the stock shock. Once that bolt is removed the steering knuckle flew fowards almost smaking me in the face. I had to keep the knuckle pushed back by hanging a caliper hanger from the upper control arm to the spot on the knuckle where the ball joint goes into. This was because if the knuckle flings forward it pulls the break line and that is no bueno.",

        "contentOnePics": ["stock_suspension", "shock_nuts"],
        "contentTwo": "After the knuckle was out of the way, I used a breaker bar on the 19mm shock mount bolt. This bolt on the Z is actually part of the sway bar endlink so the endlink needs to be complely removed from the car in order to be able to remove the shock mount bolt. I had to use a hammer and a breaker bar to remove the endlink bolt that connects to the swar bar. This was way easier than fighting the bolt with only the breaker bar. One trick I like to do is to put a jack under the steering knuckle and slightly jack it up to relieve any possible tension that may exist on that shock bolt when the suspension components are hanging. Ok, so now the speed sensors on the right of the shock need to be pulled out of the brackets in order to make additional room for the shock coming out / to not damage them. The shock came out pretty easily at that point, but another trick that can be used here is to pull down on the knuckle, which will pull down the shock and give even more room to pull it out. Once the shock is out it's time to remove the upper control arm by removing the two 15mm bolts that are holding it in, and that's all the components removed yay!",

        "contentThree": "The Fortune Auto coilovers need to have about 1/8th inch of preload added to the spring so I did that by first measuring the length of the spring, then loosening the top spindle with a 5mm hex, and turning the spring perch until the spring compressed 1/8th inches. I took the stock upper control arm and put it side by side to the new SPL one. You can tell which control arm goes on what side by looking at how the stock upper control arm ball joint is tilted. So, for the drivers side the ball joint should look kinda like this \\ if you look at it from the front. The SPL instructions are pretty straight forward, but they basically tell you to set the length of the arms as close as you can get them to the stock ones before installation, which involved using a 3/8th hex socket to loosen itty bitty hex bolts on the arms and then eventually torqueing them down to 150 in/lbs which is 12.5 ft/lbs. One of these hex bolts snapped while torqueing it down because I read the torque spec in ft/lbs and torqued it down to 150 ft/lbs!!",
        "contentThreePics": ["fuca", "broken_hex_bolt"],
        "contentFour": "Alright the fun part is putting everything back together. So, I started by putting the upper control arm back and torqueing those bolts down to 42 ft/lbs. Next I put the coilover into the shock mount and slid the endlink / shock mount bolt through. The other end of the endlink that attaches to the sway bar cant be bolted back on unless you unbolt the other side of the car too so the sway bar can freely move. I made the mistake of bolting the drivers side endlink to the sway bar, which added tension on the passengers side endlink swaybar bolt, making it impossible to remove. So, I had to slightly jack up the drivers sway bar until I could slide the endlink out and then the sway bar was free to move. I also used a 17mm wrench to hold the nut on the endlink side from spinning when tightening the endlink bolt to the sway bar. At this point, both the endlinks were bolted onto the sway bar at the same time with no tension on either side. The shock mount bolt was torqued down to 120 ft/lbs and the endlink-sway bar bolt was torqued to 62 ft/lbs.",

        "contentFive": "All that is left is to bolt down the top of the coilovers and pop the ball joint of the upper control arm into the steering knuckle. Totally not frustrating :/. To get the coilover mounted at the top I had to jack up the knuckle very carefully until the three bolts on the top of the coilover went through the holes. I tried by myself but the knuckle kept flying towards me and the coilover kept moving so it was hard to line it up at top. This was a bit tricky by myself so I got my wife to control the jack while I held the coilover in place so it would stop flopping around. I added tape to the inside of the socket and inserted the nuts for these three bolts so that the 12mm nut wouldnt accidentally fall off and into the engine bay as I attempted to put them back onto the coilover top hat. These three bolts were torqued to 24 ft/lbs. Getting the ball joint into the knuckle was a huge pain in the ass. It did not want to go in at all. I had to go to Lowes and buy a c clamp and a pry bar. I used the pry bar initially to pry open the slot where the ball joint goes in, trying to make some room for it to slide in. This kinda worked but the c clamp was much easier to use and forced the ball joint in super easy. So the front is all done and all I have left is to wait for a new hext bolt to be delivered for the drivers side upper control arm ;_;, but overall a good learning / refresher day.",

Nissan calls these katanas. I don't know why they thought these looked good, but after seeing what people on the Z forums where doing to them I started to watch way too many chrome delete DIY videos. You can either color match them to your car, or do a matte black wrap. I decided to go with the gloss black wrap since I thought it would look better with the black roof and black wheels and other black accents already on the car. I also decided to try and do it myself since paying a professional to do it would be between $350-$400 in my area. Most of the supplies were bought from Amazon for about $80 total and I already owned a heat gun from rolling my 350z's fenders.",

Removing the rear ones requires you to buy a replacement part, since Nissan strongly suggests to replace one of the pieces that you have to remove to get them off. So I did the next best thing and left them on the car. I started by cleaning the area with isopropyl alcohol and then taped off the areas around the katanas. I then cut the wrap into strips that were about 3 inches longer than they needed to be just incase. I peeled off the backing and applied the wrap to the katana, using a squeegee to smooth out any air bubbles. I then used a heat gun to heat up the wrap and make it more pliable, allowing me to stretch it around the end corners. The corners turned out to be a lot more difficult than youtube led me to believe. The rear ones weren't that bad since you have more room to stretch the wrap around the corners and work them in flat in the space between the roof and the trunk lid. However, the front ones were a pain to get completely flat. Most of the time I spent wrapping was spent trying to get the corners flat. The wrap then got tucked in under the katanas using a squeegee, an exacto knife was used to trim off the extra wrap around the tucked in parts, and then used the heat gun again to seal the edges.",

The corners for the front pieces dont look good and arent flat. I did mess up cutting the wrap in some spots because you have to cut the wrap slow enough to be able to cut in a straigh line. When I rushed or sped up, the knife moved around. I was also trying to get one of the rear pieces tucked in and it wouldnt tuck completely for some reason, which got me super frustrated and in my rage I blasted the wrap with too much heat from the heat gun, melting part of the rubber trim piece that is part of the quarter glass. :/ that's what I get. Nissan doesnt sell the rubber trim pieces so I have to buy a new quarter glass, which costs about $400 without taking into account the labor for the install. No thanks, I found one from a junk yard for $100. Overall I'd say it is a 6/10 - 7/10 job, but I'll probably bring it to a professional to get done next time because all the trouble IMO wasnt worth it..",

        "contentOne": "Once upon a time Spare Parts was a World of Warcraft guild on Ashkandi Horde, built from the remnants of an older guild. I always thought the name sounded better for a car crew. So here we are. I'll be using this site to document my car build, share relevant notes I've taken like calculating offsets / calculating tire stretch / rebuilding or resizing 3 piece wheels etc with sources, and mostly scream into the void. I don't know how often this will be updated, but if anyone even reads this, then I hope it's not terrible :/",

For example, lowered cars, very slightly stretched tired, and wheels that sit flush with the fenders. That's the same philosophy I strive to bring to my car.",
